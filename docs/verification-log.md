# Verification log

What was checked against a live cluster, when, and what it actually returned.

Rules for this file, from `spec/10-KICKOFF-PROMPT.md`:

- Paste **actual output**, not a summary of it. "Worked" is not a result.
- If a check fails, record the exact error text and which fallback you took.
- Never write a placeholder number. Write `TBD`.

Cluster: `agent-hack-30704`, CockroachDB Cloud on `aws-us-east-1`,
`CockroachDB CCL v26.2.5 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, built 2026/07/28 18:56:00, go1.25.5)`.
Tier: **Basic** (the free tier), which is what `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 assumed
for V1 and V2. Both assumptions held.
Database `defaultdb`, SQL user `julian`, `sslmode=verify-full`.

`SET CLUSTER SETTING feature.vector_index.enabled` is permitted for this user, so
`sql/001_init.sql` line 6 does not block the migration.

## V1 — Vector index with a prefix column

Spec: `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 · Fallback: brute-force ordering, no index

**Result:** PASS, but only after fixing an opclass bug in our own SQL. Vector
indexes are creatable on this cluster, the prefix column works, and isolation
genuinely lives in the index.

The nearest-neighbour query was correct from the start. Three rows from scope 1,
nearest first; the scope-2 row is absent, which is the property that matters:

```
[
  { "id": "99dff10d-8dcb-4bdd-8729-03f7b9b329ae", "dist": 0 },
  { "id": "74ee98e0-c905-44f2-98ca-b32d52d712c5", "dist": 0.006116251198662548 },
  { "id": "3f6446d2-b996-4805-bba5-2938b68d1209", "dist": 1 }
]
```

Did the EXPLAIN plan mention the vector index rather than a full scan? **Not at
first — it full-scanned**, while still returning those correct rows:

```
• top-k
│ order: +column8
│ k: 3
└── • render
    └── • filter
        │ filter: scope = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
        └── • scan
              missing stats
              table: _v1@_v1_pkey
              spans: FULL SCAN

index recommendations: 1
1. type: index creation
   SQL command: CREATE INDEX ON defaultdb.public._v1 (scope) STORING (e);
```

The index existed. `SHOW CREATE TABLE _v1` returned:

```
VECTOR INDEX _v1_scope_e_idx (scope, e vector_l2_ops)
```

**Cause: operator/opclass mismatch, not a tier or version limit.** The default
opclass is `vector_l2_ops`, which serves `<->` but not `<=>`. Every query in
`spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` orders by `<=>` (§4.1 recall, §4.2 dedupe, §4.4
consolidation) and `DEDUPE_THRESHOLD` is specified as cosine distance at §5, so
the schema was asking for cosine against an L2 index. Four EXPLAINs isolate it:

| Query | Index opclass | Rows | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<->` | `vector_l2_ops` | 4 | vector search |
| `<->` | `vector_l2_ops` | 2000 | vector search |
| `<=>` | `vector_l2_ops` | 2000 | **FULL SCAN** |
| `<=>` | `vector_cosine_ops` | 2000 | vector search |

Row count was never the factor — it indexed four rows happily. With the opclass
corrected the plan uses the index, and the prefix column bounds the search:

```
• top-k
└── • render
    └── • lookup join
        │ table: _v1@_v1_pkey
        └── • vector search
              table: _v1@_v1_scope_e_idx
              prefix spans: [/'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' - /'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001']
```

That `prefix spans` line is the evidence for `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §3's claim
that isolation lives in the index rather than in a `WHERE` clause. **V5 below
retests that claim directly and finds it false as stated** — the prefix bounds the
search when it is supplied, but omitting it falls back to a full scan rather than
returning nothing. Read this section together with V5.

**Fallback not needed.** Fixed instead, in `sql/001_init.sql` (both
`intents_semantic` and `findings_semantic`) and in `sql/000_verify.sql`.

Worth stating plainly: with the default opclass this would have shipped. Results
stay correct, so nothing fails — the demo corpus is small enough that a full scan
looks instant. The submission would have claimed a vector index it was not using.

## V4 — Row-level TTL

Spec: `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §1 · Fallback: none specified — working memory
reclamation depends on this

**Result:** PASS. Both storage parameters were accepted and the sweeper actually
reclaimed the row. Working-memory reclamation stands, which matters because this
is the one check with no fallback.

`SHOW CREATE TABLE _v4` — note the cluster added `ttl = 'on'` itself:

```
CREATE TABLE public._v4 (
	k STRING NOT NULL,
	expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT _v4_pkey PRIMARY KEY (k ASC)
) WITH (ttl = 'on', ttl_expiration_expression = 'expires_at', ttl_job_cron = '*/1 * * * *', schema_locked = true);
```

Counts after inserting a row already an hour past `expires_at` at 14:53:53:

```
14:54:55 (+62s)   SELECT count(*) FROM _v4  ->  1
14:57:34 (+221s)  SELECT count(*) FROM _v4  ->  0
```

So reclamation landed somewhere between 62 and 221 seconds, against a
`*/1 * * * *` cron. **The two-minute wait this file prescribes is not long
enough** — at 62 seconds the row was still present, and a check at exactly two
minutes could plausibly have read `1` and been recorded as a failure. Allow four
minutes before concluding anything about TTL.

The lease semantics in `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §1 should assume the same. A
claim is not reclaimed *at* `expires_at`; it is reclaimed at the next sweep after
it, so arbitration must treat an expired-but-present claim as free rather than
waiting for the row to vanish. The uniqueness constraint on
`(repo_id, resource_key)` is what makes that safe.

The same parameters are live on the real `claims` table, confirmed after applying
`sql/001_init.sql`:

```
ttl = 'on', ttl_expiration_expression = 'expires_at', ttl_job_cron = '*/1 * * * *'
```

## V2 — Changefeed with a webhook sink

Spec: `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 · Fallback: EventBridge Scheduler polling a
watermark every two seconds · **Time box: 20 minutes, then take the fallback**

**Result:** PASS on availability, which was the risky half. Delivery to a real
endpoint is still outstanding — it needs a webhook URL and nothing else.
**The fallback is not needed.**

The assumption under test was that sink-based changefeeds might be unavailable on
this tier. They are not. `CREATE CHANGEFEED` against a deliberately unreachable
host returned a job rather than a licensing or tier refusal:

```
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE _v2
  INTO 'webhook-https://example.invalid/probe?insecure_tls_skip_verify=true'
  WITH updated, resolved = '10s';

  job_id: 1200000303041118209
```

Splitting the question this way meant the 20-minute time box never had to be
spent waiting on an external URL. `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS` then proved the cluster
reached the network and failed only on DNS:

```
status:         running
running_status: transient error: webhook sink request failed: Post
                "https://example.invalid/probe": dial tcp: lookup example.invalid
                on 172.20.0.10:53: no such host
error:          (empty)
```

So outbound HTTPS from the cluster to a webhook sink works. Probe job cancelled.

**Delivery confirmed** against a live webhook.site endpoint on Basic. The job
reached a steady delivering state rather than the DNS error above:

```
job_id:         1200003867318321153
status:         running
running_status: running: resolved=1786282517.706972690,0
error:          (empty)
```

An advancing `resolved` timestamp is the delivery proof: the sink is
acknowledging, because a changefeed only advances `resolved` once the endpoint
accepts. The events fired were an `INSERT` of row 2 and an `UPDATE` of row 1,
with `resolved = '10s'` heartbeats between them. Job cancelled afterwards — a
changefeed left running consumes RUs continuously on Basic.

**V2 therefore passes in full, on the free tier, and the EventBridge-Scheduler
fallback is not needed.**

Two things that fell out of this and belong in the design:

- A changefeed to a dead sink stays `running` with a **transient** error and
  retries indefinitely; it does not fail. The "changefeed stalled" row in
  `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 is therefore right that consolidation lags rather
  than breaks, but the staleness badge cannot be driven by job status — status
  stays `running` throughout. Drive it from the last `resolved` timestamp.
- `insecure_tls_skip_verify=true` is fine for a webhook.site probe and must not
  survive into the deployed API Gateway sink.

## V3 — Historical query window

Spec: `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §6 · Fallback: drop the time-travel panel

**Result:** PASS. The window is **4500 seconds — 75 minutes**. The time-travel
panel survives; the fallback is not needed.

Which offset first failed, and the exact GC-threshold error: **no GC-threshold
error was produced, and the method in this file cannot produce one.** Every offset
from `-30s` to `-72h` returned the same thing:

```
[13] SELECT count(*) FROM _v2 AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-30s'
  FAILED code=42P01
  relation "_v2" does not exist
```

That is name resolution, not garbage collection. `_v2` was seconds old, so at any
past timestamp it did not exist yet, and CockroachDB resolves the descriptor at
the historical timestamp before it ever consults the GC threshold — `42P01` wins
first. Probing outward to `-4h`, `-24h`, `-25h`, `-48h` and `-72h` changed
nothing. **Reading a table younger than the window can never surface the
boundary.** To get a real GC error the table must be older than the GC TTL, which
means waiting 75 minutes.

The authoritative answer, from `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR TABLE _v2`:

```
ALTER RANGE default CONFIGURE ZONE USING
	range_min_bytes = 134217728,
	range_max_bytes = 536870912,
	gc.ttlseconds = 4500,
	num_replicas = 3,
	num_voters = 3,
	constraints = '{+region=aws-us-east-1: 3}',
	voter_constraints = '[]',
	lease_preferences = '[[+region=aws-us-east-1]]'
```

`gc.ttlseconds = 4500` is the rewind limit, and it confirms the ~75 minutes
`spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §6 assumed. Note it is on `RANGE default`, so it applies
cluster-wide rather than to this table.

The demo must therefore not offer a rewind beyond 75 minutes, and should read the
bound at runtime rather than hardcoding it — a zone-config change would otherwise
turn the panel into an error page, which rung 1 of the degradation ladder in
`spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 forbids.

## V5 — Does the index prefix isolate tenants on its own?

Spec: `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §2 · Prompted by: writing §8 test 8 (recall scoped
to repo A never returns repo B)

**Result: FAIL — the claim does not hold.** The prefix does not isolate tenants.
The `WHERE repo_id` clause does, and it is load-bearing.

§2 states that `VECTOR INDEX (repo_id, embedding)` "partitions the index by
repository, so one tenant's memory cannot surface in another tenant's recall even
if an application filter is forgotten. Isolation lives in the index, not in a
`WHERE` clause." V1 recorded `prefix spans` as evidence for that. V1 only ever
tested the case where the filter **is** present, so it could not have caught this.

Two `findings` rows, identical embeddings, different `repo_id`s. Same ordering,
with and without the filter:

```
with repo filter : [ 'repo A secret' ]
without filter   : [ 'repo A secret', 'repo B secret' ]
```

Repo B's row came back. The plans say why — supply the prefix and the vector index
is used and bounded; omit it and the planner does not refuse, it full-scans:

```
-- no prefix supplied
└── • scan
      table: findings@findings_pkey
      spans: FULL SCAN

-- prefix supplied
└── • vector search
      table: findings@findings_semantic
      prefix spans: [/'7dbd0b59-…-d3c2d205c02c' - /'7dbd0b59-…-d3c2d205c02c']
```

**What the prefix actually buys**, stated accurately so the README does not
overclaim it to a judge:

- Per-tenant recall is the indexed fast path, and its cost does not grow with
  other tenants' data.
- A forgotten filter is *visible* — it shows up as `FULL SCAN` in the plan rather
  than quietly serving from a shared index.

**What it does not buy:** a forgotten filter fails **open**, not closed. Isolation
is an application-level property of the query, exactly the thing §2 says it is not.

Consequences:

1. `spec/03-MEMORY-MODEL.md` §2 corrected; the design note no longer claims the
   index is the boundary.
2. `src/memory/recall.ts` carries the correction inline, so the `WHERE` clause is
   not "simplified away" later as redundant.
3. **This changes §8 test 9.** `cortex_demo` confinement cannot rest on the index
   prefix, which was the cheap reading of the §3 `[OPEN]` decision. Confinement has
   to come from the principal's own grants — a separate cluster, or row-level
   authorization — because an application query is exactly what an anonymous demo
   path might get wrong, and the index will not catch it.

## Bedrock model access

Per-account and per-region, and a classic day-three surprise.

**The premise of this check has changed.** AWS retired the Model access page:

> Serverless foundation models are now automatically enabled across all AWS
> commercial regions when first invoked in your account [...] Note that for
> Anthropic models, first-time users may need to submit use case details before
> they can access the model.

So there is no page to read a granted/not-granted status off. Access is no longer
something you confirm in advance — **it is only observable by invoking the model**,
and the Anthropic use-case gate can still fire on that first invocation. The
day-three surprise this check exists to prevent has not gone away; it has moved
from a settings page to the first real call.

- Region: `us-east-1`, matching the cluster's `aws-us-east-1`
- Titan Text Embeddings V2: `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` — **unverified**, and
  verifiable only by invoking. Produces the 1024 dimensions `intents.embedding`
  and `findings.embedding` are declared with.
- Reasoning model: `anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` (Bedrock IDs carry the
  `anthropic.` prefix) — **unverified**, same reason. Chosen over
  `anthropic.claude-opus-5` per `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §5, which calls for the
  smallest adequate model because LIVE reasoning is the only real cost variable.

**Action:** invoke both models once, in `us-east-1`, before day three, and paste
the result here. A smoke call is now the only form this check can take.

## Service accounts

Three principals, per `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.

All three principals exist on the cluster (`SHOW USERS`): `cortex_reader`,
`cortex_writer`, `cortex_demo`, alongside `julian`, `admin`, `root`.

- `cortex_reader` created, `SELECT` only, verified with `SHOW GRANTS`: **YES**
- `cortex_writer` created, no `SELECT`-only overlap: **created, but see the
  discrepancy below — it currently holds `SELECT` too**
- `cortex_demo` created, confined to demo session scopes: **created, deliberately
  ungranted**
- Confinement mechanism chosen (separate cluster vs scoped `repo_id`s), and why: TBD

`SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE claims`, filtered to the `cortex%` principals:

```
grantee          privilege_type
cortex_reader    SELECT
cortex_writer    DELETE
cortex_writer    INSERT
cortex_writer    SELECT
cortex_writer    UPDATE
```

The read plane is clean: `cortex_reader` holds `SELECT` and no write verb, which
is the property `spec/04-ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 rests its prompt-injection argument
on. `cortex_demo` holds nothing — granting it table-level writes before the §3
`[OPEN]` confinement decision is made would hand an anonymous visitor the whole
table and break the second invariant, so its grant waits on that decision rather
than being provisionally issued.

**Discrepancy — `sql/001_init.sql` over-grants relative to the spec, twice.**
The file's own header says the spec wins and the file is a bug when they
disagree, so both are recorded here rather than silently reconciled:

1. **`cortex_writer` has `SELECT`.** §3 specifies `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
   "and nothing else". The SQL grants `SELECT` as well. This is not obviously
   wrong in practice — Flow B returns "the holder's identity and prior outcome",
   which is a read — so either the SQL is over-granting or §3's "nothing else"
   understates what the arbitration transaction needs.
2. **The grants cover six tables, not four.** §3 says "all four tables"; the
   schema has six. `repos` and `agents` are identity tables rather than memory
   tiers, and the grants currently include them.

Both need a decision before this section can be called done, because this is the
section §3 identifies as the one judges read for Product Readiness.
